## To find the role of clitellum in regeneration of earthworms-Vaibhavi

Many times earthworms are amputated (cut into two pieces) to study their regeneration pattern. So once I was observing a set up done by my seniors where they amputated earthworms, they were mainly named as Anterior and Posterior parts. 
The experimental set up was such
- Tail amputation - TA - Tail Anterior/ TP - Tail Posterior x5 (5 earthworms) 
- Middle amputation - MA - Middle Anterior/ MP - Middle Posterior x5
- Head amputation - HA - Head Anterior/ HP - Head Posterior x5          

So in this set up a few earthworms died and few survived, healed, regenerated. So it was observed that the parts of the earthworm that had the clitellum Regenerated.                
Now we may ask what is a clitellum?
Clitellum is located near the head of the earthworm, a light band kind of segment that stands out from the rest of the body of the earthworm. The clitellum harbours the genitals and has the genital pores for the exchange of male and female gametes. 
So I have a hypothesis, that the clitellum is responsible for the regeneration of the earthworm because I observed that the parts that had the clitellum regenerated but the parts without clitellum died. So I did a similar experiment with more earthworms and observed the similar observations. But these observations do not seem conclusive accurately, so by collaboration with other cubists I came down with these experimental setups.
- To amputate at the head after the clitellum.
- To amputate at the centre of the clitellum. 
- To completely cut out the clitellum from the earthwormâ€™s body.

**Expectations**
- The part with clitellum that is the head regenerates.
- Both the parts will have half of the clitellum, so both the parts should regenerate.
- The clitellum should regenerate back its head and tail and the original parts will not survive.                 

So these are the three experiments that can confirm if the clitellum plays a major role in the regeneration of earthworms.

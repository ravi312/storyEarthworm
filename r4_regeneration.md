You must've  heard of a disease called paralysis, paralysis is one of the most common diseases in the world, approximately 5.4 million people are living with paralysis today. paralysis is often caused due to  damage, injury or malfunctioning of the nerve cord, resulting in loss of neural function and then leads in malfunctioning  and improper movements of muscles in various parts of the body.
Here we are using earthworm as a model organism to study paralysis and related disorders because it can regenerate, and also it has similarities in their nervous system with humans. As we have a spinal cord earthworms have a ventral nerve cord, it is called ventral because it is present at the side from which the earthworm crawls and it is called ventral side.

If any damage happens to the ventral nerve cord of the earthworm it gets healed by regeneration whereas in the human body we need to find out the proteins which can help in triggering regeneration in the human nerve cord. By studying Ventral nerve cord of earthworms and it's regenerative property we can find out pathways which  can be applicable for human nervous system also
To achieve this goal on primary level we are    performing behavioural assay (experiment) i.e, RER (Rapid escape response) which can be used to find out and to study regeneration time of ventral nerve cord of the earthworm.

In this we perform several runs of RER assay, for control initially we put earthworm in distilled water for 2 minutes & for test we put earthworm in 200mM NaCl solution. We expect  earthworm to come out of  the NaCl solution because it has a proper and functional ventral nerve cord.

Same procedure is repeated  after giving a lesion (cut) to the ventral nerve side of the earthworms.
After lesion we expect that earthworms   should not come out of 200mM NaCl solution due to injury and disconnection between the nerve cord.
By this method we can find out time required for the ventral nerve cord of earthworms to regenerate.

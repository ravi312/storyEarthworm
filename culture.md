# Culturing Earthworm at home (Ritik) :-

It is very easy to culture earthworms with the minimal things we have 

## Material needed:-

- A plastic cup
- Tissue paper
- Needle
- Muslin cloth
- Rubber band.
- Plastic tray
- Filter paper
- Brush
- Earthworms

## Method:- 

1. Take a plastic cup and make holes under it  with the help of the needle
2. Then make bits of tissue paper and add it into the cup until the the cup is filled fully with the bits of tissue paper
3. Then add tap water into the cup until the paper is partially moist, as you add water the tissue paper will settle down.
4. Follow step 2 and 3 until the cup is half filled with moist tissue paper.
5. Now add 4-5 earthworms in this half filled cup with the help of a brush.
6. fill the cup completely with moist tissue if you want to put 10-12 earthworms in one cup.
7. Cover the plastic cup with a piece of muslin cloth and rubber band.
8. Take a plastic tray and add 3-4 layers of filter in it, add water to the filter paper until the filter papers are completely wet.
9. Place your tissue cup cultures of earthworms in this tray.
10. Add 100-150ml water to the tray daily so that the tissue in the cup remains moist, as we've made holes under the cup the water will enter the cups and keep the tissues inside the cup moist.

Note :- There can always be an alternative for the material we have 

For eg:- If you do not have plastic cups you can take a plastic bottle instead, cut it into half and make holes under it and also if you do not have a rubber band you can also use thread instead.

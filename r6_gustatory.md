# To study gustatory response in earthworm - Riya

Gustatory is a word used to describe the sense of taste . To sense the taste of food we humans have a  particular organ assigned for it. In humans it is our tongue but for earthworms it is their skin . Amazingly these earthworms get their taste of food through their skin !
The process of sensing is done by some protein structure called receptors which when come in contact with a substance , reacts and produces a stimulation which is then passed to the brain through nerves .For taste these are called the gustatory receptors Such receptors are present on the tongue in humans , however in earthworms their skin is covered with chemo receptors which also work as gustatory receptors . These  receptors help the earthworm in selection of food ,detecting the taste ,sensing the surrounding environment. Also they can help finding mates by detecting the mucus secretion of other earthworms.

The gustatory response of earthworms can be best studied with the help of salt. A lot of us must have tried experimenting with salt on an earthworm. An earthworm's  skin gets easily irritated by salt due to its hypersensitivity to salt . As we know, earthworms, like humans, do not have a respiratory tract. They breathe through their skin which is covered with mucus to keep their skin moist as to carry the process. Over exposure of earthworms to salt causes their skin to dry out due to osmosis. As their skin dries the process of respiration is blocked resulting in their death. However it can still survive in little quantities of salt or less concentration of salinity. Therefore earthworms mostly avoid the regions with high concentration of salinity. So the gustatory receptors of the earthworm help them to sense the environment suitable for them to survive.

I , with the help of my other collaborators have designed a gustatory assay setup so that I can study up  to which concentration of salt does earthworm prefer and how ?

## The gustatory assay

For this we have used NaCl salt solutions of different concentrations i.e 100mM ,200mM and 300mM . Further on a glass slide , we keep two strips of filter paper one dipped  in NaCl and the other dipped in water adjacently with a minimum of 5 mm gap in between where we leave an earthworm to take the run . The setup is designed such that the earthworm has to take a move towards the NaCl or water for which it prefers. Earthworm do this by sensing the environment through its receptors. As we have used three concentrations of NaCl  we perform the assay with these concentrations separately against water. After that we perform the essay now by using NaCl concentration against other NaCl concentration for e.g. 100 mM against 200mM , 200mM against 300mM and 300mM against itself . We repeat the assay till we take 30 readings of each . 

### Expectations

1. While performing NaCl concentration against water we expect the earthworm to move towards water as salt can be toxic for its skin.
2. When taking runs with NaCl on both sides we expect the earthworms to move towards lower concentration . Such that
100mM vs 200mM – more earthworms should move towards  100mM
200mM vs 300mM –  readings towards 200mM should be more 
The gustatory  assay performed with 300mM against water where the earthworm reflexes towards water 

### Results

We collected the data and converted it into percentage which can make us easy to compare all the readings . Surprising that our readings are mostly similar to our expectations .  We saw the earthworm can move on filter paper dipped in 100mM as that in water which means salinity level of 100mM can be suitable for them. During  200mM used  against water  about 80% earthworms of the readings taken moved towards water . The rest 20% were able to  move on 200mM filter paper. Earthworms totally avoided moving forward at 300mM . This tells us that salinity levels of not more  100mM can be preferred for an earthworm to survive  well. 

When performing the assay with NaCl concentration on both the sides earthworms preferred to move  towards the side with lower concentration. When used 200mM against 300mM , 95% earthworms moved towards 200 mM   which they avoided earlier when used against water . Readings taken with 100mM vs 200mM shows that about 98% of the earthworms choose 100mM .

So can you think  this can suggest to us the idea of  learning decision making in earthworms?!

As we know earthworms do not have proper  sense organs like humans do  which help humans in making decisions regarding wise , earthworms  does have the ability to choose their environment selectively. As in assay we saw that earthworm can choose upon the surrounding to move on brings forward the question of how it takes decisions  with not so developed sensory systems or what is that they moved towards toxic levels which they were avoiding earlier by obviously thinking that moving towards the other side can harm them .  As decision making studies are being going on to treat  people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) , earthworms can also be an excellent organism to take up these neurobiology studies on which we can further relate to humans .
